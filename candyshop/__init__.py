``candyshop`` is just pure art.

Candyshop is a package that serves as a processor of the information
contained in Odoo Modules. It's primarily aimed at making reports of missing
dependencies in an Odoo Environment.

It has abstractions that represent Odoo Modules and virtual Odoo Enviroments,
as well as functions to resolve dependency trees.
