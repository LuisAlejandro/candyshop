Current version: 0.2.0

Candyshop is a helper to determine if all your dependencies are declared
properly. A Candyshop is a place where you can pick sweets and candies from
a list of wonderful options, but choose wisely.

For more information, please read the `full documentation`_.

Features
========

* Access an Odoo Module as an object abstraction.
* Get all module references from all xml files of a module.
* Generate and clone the dependency tree of a group of modules (bundle).
* Generate a virtual enviroment where you can add group of modules.
* Determine which Odoo Modules declare a dependency to another module that is not
  present in the environment.
* Determine which XML files make reference to an Odoo Module that is not present
  in the environment.

Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/candyshop

The ``candyshop`` program is written in python and hosted on PyPI_. Therefore, you can use
pip to install the stable version::

    $ pip install --upgrade candyshop

If you want to install the development version (not recomended), you can install
directlty from GitHub like this::

    $ pip install --upgrade https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/candyshop/archive/master.tar.gz

Usage
-----

Here you can consult practical uses for some of the Candyshop functions.
For a more detailed review on what you can do with it, we recommend you to read
the `api` documentation.

The ``Module`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Module`` class is an abstraction of an Odoo Module. You can perform
several operations to access the module information::

    from candyshop.bundle import Module

    # Create a Module instance
    module = Module('path/to/module')

    # Query for data
    print(module.path)
    print(module.manifest)

    # Query information in manifest file
    print(module.properties.name)
    print(module.properties.version)
    print(module.properties.depends)

The ``Bundle`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Bundle`` class is an abstraction of a *Group* of modules, often referred
to as *Addons*. Here you can see how to interact with a bundle::

    from candyshop.bundle import Bundle

    # Create a Bundle instance
    bundle = Bundle('path/to/bundle')

    # Query for data
    print(bundle.name)
    print(bundle.path)
    print(bundle.modules)
    print(bundle.oca_dependencies)

The ``Environment`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Environment`` class is an abstraction of a virtual Odoo Environment.
Think of it as an imaginary container inside of which you can add ``Bundles``
and ask for specific information about them. For example::

    from candyshop.environment import Environment

    # Create an Environment
    env = Environment()

    # Insert bundles
    # If any bundle has an oca_dependencies.txt file,
    # clone its dependencies and insert them as bundles
    env.addbundles(['./path-to-bundle', '../addons', '../etc'])

    # Make a report about dependencies that are not present in
    # the environment
    env.get_notmet_dependencies_report()

    # Make a report about record ids that reference modules
    # which are not present in the environment
    env.get_notmet_record_ids_report()
